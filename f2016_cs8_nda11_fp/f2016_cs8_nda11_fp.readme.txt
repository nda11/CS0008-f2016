What I have done so far was that I took your code and I adjusted it.
First , what I add is that participant class which are containing seven functions
, three of which are class constructor ,
the second increment the total distance
 and runs counter and the third sums up all distances in the list.
 the rest functions returns distances, name , runs, and format.
Second, I create participants lis and
I looped through it to get name and distance.
 Then I summed all participants distance.
 next I adjust on the loop that get the min and max distances
  moreover,I adjust the total Number Of Participant
  With Multiple Records.
Finally I create a for loop to get the result .
The rest I don't change it.
