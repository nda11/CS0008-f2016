First we should read a filename(master)txt file.
and check if the file name is right then lower
the input.
We can do it with a function that returns
a list of input file lines.
On the next step one has to process a csv file.
the first line containing columns header
to skip (name , distant line) with readline()
we can iterate the remaining
lines and split them with comma separator into two
parts: name and distance
In the main function we can gather all the pairs using nested
for loops: iterate each (name, dist) pair from the csv file,
which, in turn, is given by the other loop on the lines read
from the master file.
We can construct a list of a participant names
using set and passing the whole names list to it.
Then, we can create a dictionary with distinct participant
names as keys
and a list of distances run by each participant as values.
total distance run by all participants is obtained by summing
all distances in the list of (name, dist) pairs.
From the above mentioned list  of (name, dist) pairs
one can get both minimal and maximal individual distance
