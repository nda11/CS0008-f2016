# First I used a fellow chart  to solve the problem . Then I:
# assign value to variables  USC and metric

# assign value to variables (1mile,1gallon,1liter, 1 kilometer )


# get user unit input


# condition choose between two unit::
# or
# Display when user don't choose a unit

# Here is the calculation:
# Using If and elif
# USC
# display the unit choose
# get distance drove by miles
# get consumption by gallon
# calculate the miles per gallon
# convert distance from mile to kilometer
# convert consumption from gallon to liters
# calculate the consumption from liters per kilometer

# Display the schedule(result)

# set the consumption rate by using if and elif condition and display
# the consumption rate after the schedule(result)



# metric
# display the unit choose
# get distance drove by kilometers
# get consumption by liters
# convert distance from kilometer to mile
# convert consumption from liter to gallon
# calculate the miles per gallon
# calculate the consumption from liters per kilometer

# Display the schedule( result)

# set the consumption rate by using if and elif condition and display
# the consumption rate after the schedule(result)
