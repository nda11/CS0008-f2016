# Description:Starting with Python, Chapter 2,
# Notes:
# any notes to the instructor and/or TA goes here
# ...and now let's program with Python

# exercise 5
#this program is measuring the distace that a car travels
# set value to distance variables, speed
#distance= speed * time
speed = 90


# set value to the time variable
time1=6
time2=10
time3=15
time4=2.25

# get the distance traveled
distance1=speed *time1
distance2=speed *time2
distance3=speed *time3
distance4=speed *time4

#Dispaly the distance traveled
print("traveling at 90Km/h...")
print("The distance the car will travel in 6 hours",distance1,'km')
print("The distance the car will travel in 10 hours",distance2,'km')
print("The distance the car will travel in 15 hours",distance3,'km')
print("The distance the car will travel in 2 hours and 25 minutes",distance4,'km')
