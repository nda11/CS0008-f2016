First of all, I created a function called process file(ft)
 that processes the file opening in a reading mode.
 I assigned variables to distance run and number of lines(ptn,pd)
 equal zero.
 In side this function; I used the (for) loop to read throw the file.
  Then, I Remove the new line and split the line,
  which helps in reading the file.
  I assigned the distance run to value, which accepts float numbers.
   Next, iteration and increasing the counting distance run and a number of lines for each loop. Then, closing file.
   At the end of this function, I return the distance
   and a number of lines to the function.

I create printKV function that includes t
he defining the key length and get the max space
I used if the value is integer and float using (isinstanc).
 Then printing the format, using if and elif (isinstance).
Then, I create the infinite loop ask the user for the file name.
Here I used (try function) to use exception.
I prompt the user to write the file name; then I used if condition to exit from the program if the user chooses to and display the exit statement.
Here I called the processfile(fh)
that goes back to be processed the file.

Then, display the Total# of lines and distance run .
Assign value to Total# of lines and "Total distance run to zero.
Next, I calculate and iterate
the total # of lines and total distance run and display
the total # of lines and total distance run then,
 the exception possible IOError and Name Error
